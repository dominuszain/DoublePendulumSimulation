# DoublePendulumSimulation

This repository will be divided into two parts. The first part is where i derive the governing equations for the double pendulum using the Lagrangian method in Mathematica, purely by using symbolic manipulation. The second part would be where i solve those differential equations in Scilab to generate the plots. See the relevant paper for more information.
